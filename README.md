Iowa, Ames ML group project

# Introduction

We analyzed the Ames, Iowa housing data set available on Kaggle, to understand the nuances of house pricing with the intention to build machine learning models that predict the prices and future sales in comparable markets. We build on the knowledge and experience of successful developers and real estate agents and are able to provide a more holistic and accurate approach to evaluation, with the ultimate goal of helping our clients make better informed investments of their time and money.
